## üöÄ Features

* **Browse Content:** View a responsive grid of movies, series, and anime with key details.
* **Genre Filtering:** Filter the content by genre (Movies, Series, Anime).
* **Rating-Based Sorting:** Sort the displayed titles by rating, either from highest to lowest or lowest to highest.
* **Detailed Modal View:** Click on any movie image to open a pop-up modal with more detailed information.
* **Persistent Watchlist:** Add or remove any title to a personal watchlist. The watchlist is saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so it persists even after closing the tab.

* **Responsive Design:** A mobile-first design that ensures a great user experience on all devices, from phones to desktops.
* **Custom Pages:** Includes styled Login and 404 Error pages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web pages.
* **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox/Grid), and animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all the dynamic functionality, including filtering, sorting, modals, and managing the watchlist.
* **LocalStorage API:** To store the user's watchlist data persistently on the client-side.

## üìà Future Improvements

While this project is complete for its initial scope, here are some features that could be added in the future:

* **Search Functionality:** Add a search bar to find titles directly.
* **API Integration:** Connect the frontend to a real movie database API (like The Movie Database - TMDB) to fetch live data.
* **Backend & User Accounts:** Implement a backend (e.g., using Node.js/Express) to handle real user accounts and database storage for watchlists.
* **More Sorting Options:** Add options to sort by title (A-Z) or release date.
