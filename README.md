## üìà Future Improvements

While this project is complete for its initial scope, here are some features that could be added in the future:

* **Search Functionality:** Add a search bar to find titles directly.
* **API Integration:** Connect the frontend to a real movie database API (like The Movie Database - TMDB) to fetch live data.
* **Backend & User Accounts:** Implement a backend (e.g., using Node.js/Express) to handle real user accounts and database storage for watchlists.
* **More Sorting Options:** Add options to sort by title (A-Z) or release date.
